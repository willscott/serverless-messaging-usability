\todo{Direct Downloads}

\todo{Estimated Usage}
Look at onion connection metrics vs. onion circuit traffic to see if we can
estimate the number of "low-bandwidth" onion circuits. Correlate that with
downloads to see if \systemname is a significant contributor and if we can
estimate the "fall-off" in usage after major spikes in downloads / adoption.

\todo{Message Latency}

\subsection{User Experiences}

A study was conducted with \todo{n} users in an organization, where the
organization recommended the use of \systemname for chat within the
organization. One month after this recommendation was made, we asked active
users of \systemname to self-report their experiences using the system.
