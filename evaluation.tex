\subsection{Security}
% https://ricochet.im/files/ricochet-ncc-audit-2016-01.pdf

To validate the design and implementation of \systemname, the project took the
industry standard step of contracting an external security assessment of the
tools security. Specifically noted in the synopsis of the findings is that
the the audit was designed to find ``vulnerabilities that, if exploited,
could lead to the de-anonymization or exploitation of \systemname users.''~\cite{securityAudit}
In light of this focus, the audit found two relevant issues with \systemname:

\textit{Validation of Contact Nicknames}

\textit{Verification weak against State Level Actors}

\subsection{Micro Benchmarks}
\todo{Direct Downloads}

\todo{Estimated Usage}
Look at onion connection metrics vs. onion circuit traffic to see if we can
estimate the number of "low-bandwidth" onion circuits. Correlate that with
downloads to see if \systemname is a significant contributor and if we can
estimate the "fall-off" in usage after major spikes in downloads / adoption.

\todo{Message Latency}

\subsection{User Experiences}

A study was conducted with \todo{n} users in an organization, where the
organization recommended the use of \systemname for chat within the
organization. One month after this recommendation was made, we asked active
users of \systemname to self-report their experiences using the system.

\todo{Number of Buddies}

\todo{Fraction of buddy list online at any time}

\todo{Usability compared to centralized systems}
