The design of \systemname has evolved to address user needs. Since a primary
focus of the system is usability, we begin by explaining the usability
principles which motivated subsequent design descisions.
Special attention is given to
the process of adding contacts and the protocol for communication between
two friends, which provide the technical underpinning for the system.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Simplicity} - nothing extraneous or that the user can get wrong.
  \item \textbf{Control} - nothing should happen unless the user take an action. The user should be in control.
  \item \textbf{Compatibility} - neither platform nor versioning should prevent communication.
\end{itemize}
